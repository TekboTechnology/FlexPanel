# Getting Started Guide

## Welcome

This guide will help you understand how to configure your website easily. We will explain everything in simple terms - no technical knowledge required!

---

## What is This System?

Think of your website like a **restaurant menu**:

- **config.jsonc** = Restaurant settings (name, colors, logo)
- **pages.jsonc** = Menu categories (Projects, About Us, Contact)
- **projects.jsonc** = Individual dishes (your actual projects)
- **lang.jsonc** = Translations (words in different languages)

---

## Quick Setup Flow

### Step 1: Basic Settings (config.jsonc)

This file controls your website's **identity**. Just like a business card!

```json
{
  "website": {
    "base": {
      "name": "Your Company Name",
      "desc": "What does your company do?",
      "logo": {
        "fix": "/path/to/logo.webp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What you need to change:**
- `name` → Your company name
- `desc` → Short description of your business
- `logo` → Your logo image file

---

### Step 2: Create Categories (pages.jsonc)

Categories are like **folders** in a filing cabinet. Each category holds related projects together.

**Example for different professions:**

| Profession | Example Categories |
|------------|-------------------|
| Architect | "Residential", "Commercial", "Interior" |
| Construction | "Buildings", "Roads", "Infrastructure" |
| Real Estate | "Sale", "Rent", "Land" |
| Interior Design | "Living Rooms", "Kitchens", "Offices" |
| Agency | "Branding", "Digital", "Marketing" |
| Portfolio | "Photography", "Designs", "Case Studies" |

---

### Step 3: Add Projects (projects.jsonc)

Projects are the **actual work samples** you want to show.

Each project needs:
- A title (what you call it)
- A description (brief explanation)
- Images (photos of the work)
- Category (which folder it belongs to)

---

## Understanding the Relationship

```
pages.jsonc          projects.jsonc
    │                    │
    ├── "category1" ─────┼──► project1
    │                    ├──► project2
    ├── "category2" ─────┼──► project3
    │                    └──► project4
    └── "category3" ─────┼──► project5
                         └──► project6
```

**Important:** Categories in `projects.jsonc` (parentKey) MUST match categories in `pages.jsonc`!

## File Path Guide

### Where to put your images?

```

- Project URL: `/category-name/project-name` (e.g., `/projects/modern-villa`)

### 3. Always Test
After making changes:
1. Save your JSON file
2. Refresh your website
3. Check that everything looks correct
